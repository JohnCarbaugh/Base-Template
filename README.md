## Introduction [WIP]

react-redux-template is a boilerplate project to help start new react/redux projects quickly. It comes with working routes, example data visualization, organized redux state, and several custom built components and wrappers that I commonly use on react projects. The project is built to be responsive via flexbox and media queries. Written in Typescript.
