## Introduction [WIP]

react-redux-template is a boilerplate project to help start new react/redux projects quickly. It comes with working routes, example data visualization, organized redux state, and several custom built components and wrappers that I commonly use on react projects. The project is built to be responsive via flexbox and media queries. Written in Typescript.

### Recommended plugin [VS Code]
- TSLint
- vscode-styled-components

### dev build

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnCarbaugh/react-redux-template.git
